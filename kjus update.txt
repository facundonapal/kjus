Kjus update .. I have only 100 useful photos by the moment. I asked Marisa and then Ben for more, but he told me since yesterday we can not collect more than 1 hundred photos per hashtag. New rules of Instagram. So, I'm trying to swell the collections by manually downloading the brand's photos. Our idea of ??making a tab with 3 different lookbooks will take longer than expected.
